## Please do not use this project in production! It is still in development and may corrupt your repository.

This is a simple command line interface for git. It is written in Go and uses the native [go-git](https://github.com/go-git/go-git) library. So there is no dependency on the `git` binary. The CLI is built with [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli).

`gitcli` is fully compatible with git hooks and able to run them. Like `git` is also able to run git commands in a specific directory `-C`.

## Intention

This project offers a streamlined command-line interface for Git. It's meant to complement, not replace, the `git` binary. Designed for scripting and tool integration, it simplifies common Git tasks. Additionally, it provides a learning opportunity to understand how `git` works under the hood.
